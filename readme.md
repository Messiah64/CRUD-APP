# 🌸 Pastel Forum - CRUD Demo

Welcome to **Pastel Forum**!  
A beautiful, minimal CRUD demo for beginners to learn web development fundamentals.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Pastel Forum is a simple web app where you can:

- ✏️ **Create** posts
- 📝 **Read** posts
- 🛠️ **Update** posts
- 🗑️ **Delete** posts

All data is stored in your browser using `localStorage` — no backend required!

## 😅 Troubles Faced as a Beginner

When starting out, I ran into a few classic beginner hurdles:

- 😵‍💫 **CSS Overwhelm:**  
    Getting the layout and pastel look right was tough! Flexbox, gradients, and shadows took a lot of trial and error.

- 🧩 **JavaScript Confusion:**  
    Handling dynamic DOM updates for editing and deleting posts was confusing at first.  
    I struggled with event listeners and keeping the UI in sync with the data.

- 🗄️ **localStorage Woes:**  
    Figuring out how to persist posts and update them correctly in `localStorage` took some debugging.

- 🛑 **Form Validation:**  
    Making sure users can't submit empty posts or titles longer than allowed was tricky.

## 🌈 What Finally Worked

- 📚 **Breaking Problems Down:**  
    I split the app into small pieces: rendering posts, handling forms, and managing storage.

- 🧪 **Experimenting:**  
    I used the browser console a lot to test code and debug issues.

- 🧰 **Learning by Doing:**  
    Reading docs and copying small code snippets helped me understand how things work.

- 💡 **Iterative Improvements:**  
    I kept improving the UI and code bit by bit, instead of trying to make it perfect from the start.
